## Course 1 - Data Modeling
You will create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. You will also use ETL to build databases in Apache Cassandra.

### Contents
* Introduction to Data Modeling
* Relational Data Models
* NoSQL Data Models

### Projects
* Data Modeling with Postgres
* Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

&rarr; Model event data to create a non-relational database and ETL pipeline for a music streaming app. You
will define queries and tables for a database built using Apache Cassandra.


## Course 2 - Cloud Data Warehouses
In this course, you will learn how to create cloud-based data warehouses. Tthis will sharpen your data warehousing skills, deepen your understanding of data infrastructure, and be introduced to data engineering on the cloud using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

#### Contents
* Introduction to the Data Warehouses
* Introduction to the Cloud with AWS
* Implementing Data Warehouses on AWS

### Project - Build a Cloud Data Warehouse

&rarr; In this project, you  will act as a data engineer for a streaming music service. You will
building an ELT pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages it in Redshift, and transforms it into a set of
dimensional tables for an analytics team to find insights into what songs their users are listening to.


## Course 3 - Data Lake with Spark
Learn more about the big data ecosystem and how to use Spark to work with massive datasets. Learn about how to store big data in a data lake and query it with Spark.

#### Contents
* The Power of Spark
* Data Wrangling with Spark
* Debugging and Optimization
* Introduction to Data Lake

### Project - Build a Data Lake
&rarr; In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

## Course 4 - Data Pipelines with Airflow
Learn to schedule, automate, and monitor data pipelines using Apache Airflow. Learn to run data quality checks, track data lineage, and work with data pipelines in production.

#### Contents
* Data Pipelines
* Data Quality
* Production Data Pipelines

### Project -  Data Pipelines with Airflow

&rarr; In this project, you will work to build high grade data pipelines from reusable tasks that can be
monitored and provide easy backfills for a music streaming company, Sparkify. you will move JSON logs
of user activity and JSON metadata data from S3 and process it in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon
Redshift. To complete the project, you will need to create their own custom operators to perform tasks
such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the data as the final step.


## Data Engineering Capstone Project
The purpose of the data engineering capstone project is to give you a chance to combine what you've learned throughout the program. This project will be an important part of your portfolio that will help you achieve your data engineering-related career goals.
